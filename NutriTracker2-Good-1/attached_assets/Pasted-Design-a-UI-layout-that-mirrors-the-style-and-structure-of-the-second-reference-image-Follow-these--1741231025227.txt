Design a UI layout that mirrors the style and structure of the second reference image. Follow these detailed instructions:

1. Button Design:
Create four buttons within a pop-up modal, each in its own equally sized box.
Buttons should have the same size and position as the second reference image, ensuring perfect alignment.
The button labels are:
'Log Exercise' with a dumbbell icon
'Saved Foods' with a bookmark icon
'Food Database' with a magnifying glass icon
'Scan Food' with a camera icon
2. Button Styling:
Use a white rounded box with soft shadows for each button.
Icons should be centered within the buttons, using the same size and style as in the reference.
Ensure the icons and text are balanced, with a minimal and professional look.
Apply a subtle hover effect (e.g., a light shadow or slight scale effect) to indicate interactivity.
3. Modal Box Layout:
The modal box should be separated into 4 equal-sized boxes, with 2 boxes per row.
Maintain small padding between the boxes for a clean grid layout.
The modal should not overshadow the background but be distinct enough for focus.
4. Plus Button Design:
The plus button should match the size, position, and styling of the reference image.
Position it at the bottom center of the screen, with a consistent shadow and border radius.
The plus icon should be centered and clearly visible.
5. General Design Elements:
Use consistent colors, fonts, and icon styles throughout the UI.
Make sure all elements are perfectly aligned and maintain the same proportions as the reference.
The background should remain minimalistic, focusing attention on the modal and buttons.
6. Functional Requirements:
Ensure all buttons are fully interactive and trigger the intended actions.
The plus button should open the modal with the 4 feature buttons as described.
Provide smooth transitions and animations where applicable.
Replicate the exact layout, including spacing, sizing, and design elements, to achieve a 10/10 match with the reference UI. Test all elements for consistency and usability before finalizing the design.
