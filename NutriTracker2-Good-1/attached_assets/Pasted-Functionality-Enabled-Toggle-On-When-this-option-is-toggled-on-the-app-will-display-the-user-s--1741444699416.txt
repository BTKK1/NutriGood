Functionality:
Enabled (Toggle On): When this option is toggled on, the app will display the user's daily calorie count (e.g., "2017 Calories left") and macro breakdowns (e.g., "118g Protein left," "260g Carbs left," "56g Fat left") on the device’s lock screen and, if applicable, on the Dynamic Island (a feature on iPhone 14 Pro and later models). This provides a quick glance at the user’s progress without unlocking the device, updating in real-time as data changes (e.g., after logging food or exercise).
Disabled (Toggle Off): When toggled off (default state as shown in the image), this information will not be displayed on the lock screen or Dynamic Island. The user will need to open the app to view their calorie and macro data, maintaining privacy or reducing clutter on the lock screen.
Purpose: This feature enhances accessibility and convenience, allowing users to monitor their goals at a glance. It’s particularly useful for users who frequently check their progress throughout the day. The Dynamic Island integration (if supported) could show a compact summary (e.g., "2017 cal left") with a tap to expand into macros.
Example Behavior:
If toggled on, the lock screen might show a widget or notification like "Cal AI: 2017 cal left, 118g protein" that updates dynamically.
If toggled off, the lock screen remains free of this data, and the user sees it only within the app.
Additional Considerations
User Experience:
Both toggles should persist across app sessions (e.g., using localStorage or a similar mechanism) so the user’s preference is remembered.
Provide visual feedback (e.g., a confirmation toast) when toggling to confirm the change, especially for lock screen settings which may require device permissions.
Technical Notes:
For the lock screen and Dynamic Island feature, integration might require platform-specific APIs (e.g., iOS Widgets or Dynamic Island SDK). If not supported yet, the app could display a placeholder or prompt the user to enable it manually via system settings.
Ensure the calorie adjustment logic (if "Add burned calories" is on) recalculates the "Calories left" display and progress circle in real-time.
