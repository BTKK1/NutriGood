You are an expert fullstack developer with 30 years of experience, specializing in React.js for frontend development, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Realtime Database, Cloud Functions) for backend development. You are currently working on the "Saraat AI" calorie tracking web application in Replit, building upon the previously implemented features. The user has provided screenshots of the Widgets page and Main Dashboard, requesting the following: replicate the exact positioning, sizes, and design of the "Home," "Analytics," "Settings," and "+" icons in the bottom navigation bar, and the four boxes ("Log exercise," "Saved foods," "Food Database," "Scan food") that appear upon clicking the "+" icon. The positioning and sizes must match the original screenshots precisely, maintaining the minimalist black design. No changes to other pages (e.g., Dashboard) or backend functionality are required unless necessary to support this visual replication. Follow these steps:

#### Frontend Implementation
- **Analysis**:
  - Review the Widgets page and Main Dashboard screenshots to analyze the navigation bar and "+" icon menu:
    - **Navigation Icons**: "Home," "Analytics," "Settings," and "+" are evenly spaced at the bottom, with the "+" icon on the far right. Each of the first three icons is approximately 24x24px, centered vertically, with a 10px gap between them. The "+" icon is a black circle (~40x40px) with the "+" symbol inside, positioned at the bottom-right corner, aligned with the other icons. The navigation bar height is ~60px.
    - **Plus Menu Boxes**: Upon clicking the "+", four white rounded cards (each ~100x100px) appear in a 2x2 grid layout. The boxes are labeled "Log exercise," "Saved foods," "Food Database," "Scan food," with black icons centered inside. The grid has a 10px gap between boxes, and the overall layout is centered above the navigation bar, occupying ~200x200px total space.
  - Ensure the design matches the light gray background, white cards, and black text/icons from the original.
- **Structure Update**:
  - Update or create `/frontend/src/components/NavigationBar.jsx` to enforce the exact positioning and sizes of the navigation icons.
  - Update or create `/frontend/src/components/PlusMenu.jsx` to display the four boxes with the exact positioning and sizes when the "+" icon is clicked.
- **Functionality**:
  - Maintain existing navigation functionality: "Home" navigates to `/`, "Analytics" to `/analytics`, "Settings" to `/settings`.
  - Ensure clicking the "+" icon opens the four-box menu, with each box navigable to `/log-exercise`, `/saved-foods`, `/food-database`, `/scan-food` (as implemented earlier).
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Open or create `/frontend/src/components/NavigationBar.jsx` and use a `flex` container with Tailwind classes:
     - `fixed bottom-0 w-full h-15 bg-gray-200 flex justify-between items-center px-4` for the navigation bar.
     - Add four icons with `w-6 h-6` (24x24px) for "Home," "Analytics," "Settings," and `w-10 h-10` (40x40px) for the "+" icon.
     - Use `@heroicons/react` icons: `HomeIcon`, `ChartBarIcon`, `CogIcon`, and `PlusIcon` from `@heroicons/react/24/outline`.
     - Style icons as `className="w-6 h-6 text-black"` for the first three, and `className="w-10 h-10 bg-black rounded-full flex items-center justify-center text-white"` for the "+" icon.
     - Set `gap-2.5` (10px) between icons using Tailwind.
  2. Create or update `/frontend/src/components/PlusMenu.jsx` for the four-box menu:
     - Use a `grid grid-cols-2 gap-2.5` container with Tailwind, centered with `absolute top-1/2 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 w-50 h-50` (200x200px total).
     - Add four `div` elements, each with `w-24 h-24 bg-white rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center flex-col` (100x100px):
       - "Log exercise": `<FireIcon className="w-6 h-6 text-black" />`.
       - "Saved foods": `<BookOpenIcon className="w-6 h-6 text-black" />`.
       - "Food Database": `<SearchIcon className="w-6 h-6 text-black" />`.
       - "Scan food": `<CameraIcon className="w-6 h-6 text-black" />`.
     - Add navigation handlers using React Router (`useNavigate`) to link each box to its respective route.
  3. Update `/frontend/src/App.jsx` to render `NavigationBar` at the bottom and toggle `PlusMenu` visibility with `useState` when the "+" icon is clicked.
  4. Use browser dev tools to fine-tune CSS (e.g., adjust `px-4` or `gap-2.5`) to match the pixel-perfect 10px gaps and icon sizes from the screenshots.
- **Testing**:
  - Verify the "Home," "Analytics," and "Settings" icons are 24x24px with 10px gaps, and the "+" icon is 40x40px, all aligned vertically in a 60px-high navigation bar.
  - Ensure the "+" click opens the four-box menu centered above the navigation bar.
  - Confirm each box is 100x100px with a 10px gap, forming a 200x200px 2x2 grid, and navigates to the correct route.
  - Test responsiveness on mobile and desktop, ensuring the layout scales proportionally without distortion.

#### Backend Implementation
- **Analysis**:
  - No backend changes are required as this update is purely visual and navigational.
- **Structure Update**:
  - Ensure existing Firebase routes for the four boxes remain functional but require no adjustment.
- **Functionality**:
  - Maintain existing navigation logic.
- **Implementation Steps**:
  - Skip backend updates unless navigation routes fail post-adjustment.
- **Testing**:
  - Verify navigation routes still work after frontend changes.

#### Additional Instructions
- Add comments in `NavigationBar.jsx` and `PlusMenu.jsx` explaining the replication (e.g., "// Replicated 24x24px icons with 10px gaps for navigation bar").
- Log a `console.log` in both components to confirm rendering (e.g., `console.log('Navigation bar and plus menu positioned');`).
- Use precise measurements from the screenshots (24x24px for icons, 40x40px for "+", 100x100px for boxes, 10px gaps) to ensure exact replication.
- Avoid altering the existing color scheme or design beyond matching the original black minimalist style.

This prompt focuses exclusively on replicating the navigation bar icons and "+" menu boxes with their exact positioning and sizes, aligning with the user's specific request.
