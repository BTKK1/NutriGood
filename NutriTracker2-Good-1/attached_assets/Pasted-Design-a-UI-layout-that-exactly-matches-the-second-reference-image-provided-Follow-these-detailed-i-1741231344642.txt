Design a UI layout that exactly matches the second reference image provided. Follow these detailed instructions to achieve a perfect 10/10 match:

1. Pop-Up Modal Design:
Create a pop-up modal with four distinct buttons displayed in a 2x2 grid format.
Each button should be in a rounded, white box with soft shadows.
Ensure the modal size is compact, just like in the reference image, avoiding any large, empty spaces.
2. Button Details:
The four buttons must include:
'Log Exercise' with a dumbbell icon.
'Saved Foods' with a bookmark icon.
'Food Database' with a magnifying glass icon.
'Scan Food' with a camera icon.
Icons should be the same size as in the reference, centered with a clear and modern look.
The text should be medium-sized, aligned perfectly below the icons.
3. Button Size and Positioning:
All buttons should be the exact same size.
The spacing between the buttons should match the reference image closely.
Maintain uniform padding and ensure the buttons are not too large or too small.
4. Plus Button Design:
The plus button must be at the bottom center of the screen, matching the exact position and size of the reference.
The button should have a clear, centered plus icon with a consistent design.
5. Interaction and Animation:
Clicking the plus button should open the modal with a smooth animation.
Ensure all buttons are interactive and provide a hover or press effect to indicate functionality.
6. Design Consistency:
Stick to the same color scheme, fonts, and styling as the reference.
Avoid large containers or unnecessary elements that distract from the core modal design.
7. Testing and Validation:
Before finalizing, test all elements to ensure they match the reference in both appearance and functionality.
Double-check that all clickable elements are fully functional and that the modal opens and closes smoothly.
Replicate the exact layout, including spacing, sizing, and design elements, to achieve a perfect clone of the reference UI. The goal is to deliver a clean, polished, and professional interface that mirrors the provided design without any deviations.
