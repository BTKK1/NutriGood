I understand the issue: when you create an account by entering your email and password on the "Create an account" page and press the "Create Account" button, the account is successfully registered, but you're not being redirected to the /onboarding page as expected. Instead, you're likely being redirected to the /home page, as you’ve previously noted. Let’s break down why this is happening and identify the root cause without diving into code.

How It Should Work
Intended Flow:
You start at the root (/), which directs you to /auth (the page shown in the screenshot).
You enter your email (e.g., fagasb@gmail.com) and password, then click "Create Account".
After successful registration, the app should redirect you to /onboarding to complete the onboarding process (e.g., entering gender, height, weight, etc.), and only then should you proceed to /home.
Expected Behavior: The app recognizes that you’re a new user (since you just signed up) and enforces the /onboarding step before allowing access to /home.
How It’s Actually Working
Current Flow:
You go from / to /auth, enter your email and password, and click "Create Account".
The account is successfully created (you can see this in Firebase or through a console log).
However, instead of redirecting to /onboarding, you’re redirected to /home.
Observed Behavior: The app isn’t enforcing the onboarding step for new users, likely because it’s not correctly identifying the user as new or because a higher-level redirect is overriding the intended flow.
Why This Is Happening
Based on the activity log and the current behavior, here are the likely reasons for this issue:

Auth State Listener in App.tsx Overrides the Redirect:
The onAuthStateChanged listener in App.tsx (which monitors authentication state changes) is likely triggering as soon as the user is authenticated after sign-up. If this listener doesn’t properly check whether the user is new (e.g., by looking at an onboardingComplete flag or new_user flag), it may default to redirecting all authenticated users to /home. This would override any redirect logic set in auth.tsx during the sign-up process.
Timing Issue with Redirect in auth.tsx:
In auth.tsx, the handleEmailAuth function (which handles the "Create Account" button click) attempts to redirect to /onboarding after sign-up. However, if the onAuthStateChanged listener in App.tsx runs immediately after authentication and redirects to /home before the /onboarding navigation can take effect, the intended redirect is bypassed. This is a race condition where the global auth listener takes precedence.
Session Storage Flags Not Persisting or Being Ignored:
The app uses sessionStorage to set a new_user flag or intentional_onboarding flag during sign-up to indicate that the user should go to /onboarding. If this flag isn’t being set properly, is cleared too early, or isn’t checked correctly by the redirect logic, the app might assume the user is an existing user and redirect to /home.
Database Flag (onboardingComplete) Not Being Read Correctly:
The createUserDocument function in auth.ts sets an onboardingComplete: false flag in the user’s Firebase document to mark them as a new user. However, if the app doesn’t retrieve and check this flag before deciding where to redirect, it might default to /home. Additionally, if there’s a delay in writing this flag to the database (due to network latency or async issues), the app might not see the correct state in time.
Redirect Logic in auth.tsx Not Executing Properly:
The redirect to /onboarding in auth.tsx (inside the handleEmailAuth function) might not be executing as expected due to an early return, an error in the sign-up flow, or a condition that isn’t being met (e.g., if (intentionalOnboarding || isSignUp) might be evaluating to false unexpectedly).
What’s Likely the Root Cause
The most likely root cause is a race condition between the sign-up flow and the auth state listener:

When you click "Create Account", auth.tsx calls signUpWithEmail (from auth.ts) to register the user and set the new_user flag or onboardingComplete: false.
Immediately after the user is authenticated, the onAuthStateChanged listener in App.tsx detects the new user and redirects to /home because it doesn’t properly check the new_user or onboardingComplete status.
The redirect to /onboarding set in auth.tsx is either overridden by App.tsx or doesn’t execute in time due to the async nature of the authentication process.
The activity log shows that multiple attempts were made to fix this:

Setting new_user in sessionStorage before authentication.
Using setTimeout to delay the redirect to /onboarding.
Simplifying the redirect logic in App.tsx to avoid complex conditionals. However, the issue persists, suggesting that the onAuthStateChanged listener in App.tsx is still taking precedence and redirecting to /home before the /onboarding navigation can occur.
How to Fix This
To resolve the issue, the app needs to ensure that the /onboarding redirect for new users takes priority over any default redirect to /home. Here’s what needs to happen:

Prioritize the Sign-Up Flow’s Redirect: The handleEmailAuth function in auth.tsx should complete its redirect to /onboarding before the onAuthStateChanged listener in App.tsx can interfere. This might involve temporarily disabling the listener during sign-up or ensuring the listener checks the onboardingComplete flag.
Reliably Detect New Users: The app should consistently check the user’s state (via sessionStorage or the database) to confirm they’re new and need to complete onboarding. If onboardingComplete is false, the redirect should always be to /onboarding.
Avoid Race Conditions: Ensure the redirect to /onboarding happens synchronously after sign-up, or delay the onAuthStateChanged listener’s redirect until the user’s state is fully updated.
What to Do Next
Test Again with Console Logs: Add debug logs in auth.tsx and App.tsx to trace the redirect flow. For example, log when handleEmailAuth tries to navigate to /onboarding and when onAuthStateChanged triggers its redirect. This will confirm if App.tsx is overriding the intended flow.
Check the Database: After signing up, immediately check the user’s document in Firebase to ensure onboardingComplete is set to false. If it’s not, there’s an issue with createUserDocument.
Inspect Browser Console: Look for any errors or warnings in the browser console (right-click > Inspect > Console) after clicking "Create Account". This might reveal a failed navigation or an unexpected redirect.
The issue is fixable by ensuring the sign-up flow’s redirect to /onboarding is the final action and isn’t overridden by the auth listener. Let me know if you see any console errors or if the behavior changes after testing!
