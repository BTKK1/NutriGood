Please provide the Stripe price ID for your recurring yearly product (SAR 129.99/year) that you created in your Stripe Dashboard. Enter it as an environment variable named YEARLY_PRICE_ID (e.g., YEARLY_PRICE_ID=price_123), and I’ll help integrate it securely to add the 3-day free trial.
Wait for the user to provide the price ID before proceeding.
Install Stripe Packages
In the Replit terminal, run the command npm install @stripe/stripe-js stripe to install the Stripe packages for both the frontend and backend if they aren’t already installed.
Set Up Stripe Price ID in Replit
Once the user provides the YEARLY_PRICE_ID (e.g., price_123), add it as an environment variable in Replit’s Secrets:
Go to the Secrets tab in Replit and add YEARLY_PRICE_ID with the value provided by the user (e.g., price_123).
Ensure this variable is accessible in the code as process.env.YEARLY_PRICE_ID.
Update the Frontend Payment Page
Open /frontend/src/components/Payment.jsx and modify it to handle the "Start your 3-day FREE trial to continue." screen:
Update the page to show the title "Start your 3-day FREE trial to continue.," a timeline with three points (Today with a lock icon, In 2 Days – Reminder with a bell icon, In 3 Days – Billing Starts with a crown icon), and radio buttons for subscription plans (Monthly: SAR 39.99/mo, disabled, and Yearly: SAR 10.83/mo with a "3 DAYS FREE" badge, pre-selected).
Add a checkbox "No Payment Due Now" (checked by default) and a "Start My 3-Day Free Trial" button.
Include text below the button: "3 days free, then SAR 129.99 per year (SAR 10.83/mo)."
Add a "Restore" link in the top-right corner.
Use Stripe’s JavaScript library (@stripe/stripe-js) to initialize Stripe with the STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY (stored in Replit Secrets).
Configure the "Start My 3-Day Free Trial" button to use Stripe’s redirectToCheckout method, passing the YEARLY_PRICE_ID to set up a subscription with a 3-day free trial. Ensure it supports Apple Pay for iPhone users by including paymentMethodTypes: ['card', 'apple_pay'].
Make the button disabled until the "No Payment Due Now" checkbox is checked, and ensure it redirects to /create-account on success or stays on /payment if canceled.
Style everything with Tailwind CSS to match the minimalist design (black, white, gray, orange) and include a back arrow and progress bar at the top.
Update the Backend Payment Endpoint
Open /backend/routes/payment.js and update or create the /api/payment/trial endpoint:
Use the stripe Node.js package, initialized with the STRIPE_SECRET_KEY (stored in Replit Secrets), to create a subscription for the user.
Accept the user’s email in the request body and create a Stripe customer using that email.
Use the YEARLY_PRICE_ID to set up a subscription with a trial_period_days: 3 parameter, setting the trial end date to March 8, 2025 (or 3 days from the current date, March 5, 2025).
Ensure the subscription automatically charges SAR 129.99 annually after the trial unless canceled.
Store the subscription ID in the users table in your database (ensure a subscriptionId column exists in /backend/db.js).
Return a success response with the subscription ID or an error if something goes wrong.
Ensure Database Support
Open /backend/db.js and verify that the users table includes a subscriptionId column to store Stripe subscription IDs. If it doesn’t exist, add it to the table schema:
Create or modify the users table to include subscriptionId TEXT as a column.
Set Up Stripe Webhooks (Optional)
In the Stripe Dashboard, go to Developers > Webhooks and create a webhook endpoint for https://your-replit-url/api/payment/webhook to handle events like trial expiration (customer.subscription.trial_will_end) and billing (invoice.payment_succeeded).
In /backend/routes/payment.js, add a /api/payment/webhook endpoint to process these events, updating the user’s status in the database (e.g., trialActive, subscriptionStatus).
Test the Implementation
Use Stripe’s test mode with STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY and STRIPE_SECRET_KEY in Replit Secrets.
Click "Start My 3-Day Free Trial" in Payment.jsx to test the Stripe redirect or checkout flow, ensuring it shows Apple Pay for iPhone users in Safari (iOS 10+).
Use a test card (e.g., 4242 4242 4242 4242, any expiry date, CVC 123) to simulate the subscription setup without real charges.
Verify in the Stripe Dashboard that the subscription is created with a 3-day trial ending on March 8, 2025, and test that it automatically charges SAR 129.99 after the trial (use Stripe’s test clock to simulate time passing).
Test the back arrow to ensure it navigates correctly to the previous page, the "Restore" button (if implemented), and ensure the UI matches the screenshot’s design and responsiveness.
Handle Apple Pay for iPhone Users
Ensure the Stripe checkout includes the Apple Pay option in Safari on iPhones, triggering the native Apple Pay sheet for a one-touch subscription experience.
Test with a test card in Apple Pay to simulate the flow without real charges.
Ensure Design Consistency
Maintain the minimalist design with black, white, gray, and orange colors, rounded edges, and icons, using Tailwind CSS.
Use the "Saraat AI" app name and custom logo throughout the page.
Once these steps are completed and tested, the payment page will offer a 3-day free trial for the yearly product, automatically charging SAR 129.99 annually after the trial, with Apple Pay support for iPhone users, fixing the button issue and ensuring a seamless user experience.
