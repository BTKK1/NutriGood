Configure free trials
Delay payments on subscriptions using free trial periods.
Stripe doesn’t set a specific limit on a free trial length. Most businesses use shorter trials (such as 30 days), but you can set longer periods. However, consider:

Keeping payment methods valid for post-trial charges
Potential impact on conversion rates with longer trials

You can configure a Checkout Session to start a customer’s subscription with a free trial by passing one of the following parameters:

subscription_data.trial_period_days, the length (in days) of your free trial.
subscription_data.trial_end, a Unix timestamp representing the end of the trial period.

On the front end, recurring.trial contains the details of the session’s trial period.

Free trials without collecting a payment method
By default, Checkout Sessions collect a payment method to use after the trial ends. You can sign customers up for free trials without collecting payment details by passing payment_method_collection=if_required.

Choose whether to cancel or pause the subscription if the customer doesn’t provide a payment method before the trial ends by passing trial_settings.end_behavior.missing_payment_method.

Cancel subscription-If the free trial subscription ends without a payment method, it cancels immediately. You can create another subscription if the customer decides to subscribe to a paid plan in the future.
Pause subscription-If the free trial subscription ends without a payment method, it pauses and doesn’t cycle until it’s resumed. When a subscription is paused, it doesn’t generate invoices (unlike when a subscription’s payment collection is paused). When your customer adds their payment method after the subscription has paused, you can resume the same subscription. The subscription can remain paused indefinitely.
