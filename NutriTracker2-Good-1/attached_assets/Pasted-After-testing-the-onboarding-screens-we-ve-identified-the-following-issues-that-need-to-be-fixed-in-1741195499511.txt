After testing the onboarding screens, we’ve identified the following issues that need to be fixed in the frontend before proceeding to add the necessary backend logic:

1. Users can click the "Next" button without selecting an option on any onboarding screen, allowing them to progress through the onboarding process without providing required data. This should be prevented by ensuring a selection is made before the "Next" button is enabled or clickable.

2. The onboarding screens (e.g., "Saraat AI creates long-term results," "You have great potential to crush your goal," "Lose twice as much weight with Saraat AI vs on your own") should validate user input or selection before navigating to the next step. If no option is selected, display a clear error message (e.g., "Please select an option before continuing") in red text below the question or radio buttons.

Update the existing React components in `/frontend/src/components` and `/frontend/src/pages/Onboarding.jsx` to address these issues. Specifically:

- Modify each onboarding component (e.g., `LongTermResults.jsx`, `PotentialGoal.jsx`, `WeightComparison.jsx`) to use React state to track the user’s selection (e.g., `selectedOption`).
- Disable the "Next" button (using Tailwind CSS classes like `bg-gray-400` and `cursor-not-allowed`) or hide it until a radio button or option is selected.
- Add an error message state (e.g., `errorMessage`) that appears when the user tries to click "Next" without selecting an option. Style the error message with Tailwind CSS (`text-red-500`, `text-sm`, `mt-2`).
- Use event handlers (e.g., `onChange` for radio buttons) to update the selected option and enable the "Next" button only when a valid selection is made.
- Ensure navigation to the next step (using React Router or state management) only occurs when a selection is confirmed, preventing progression without data.

Test these changes in Replit to ensure users cannot proceed without selecting an option, and the UI provides clear feedback. Maintain the clean, minimalist design with black and white colors, rounded buttons, and icons as shown in the screenshots. Once these frontend validations are implemented and tested, we will proceed to add the necessary backend endpoints to handle the data from these screens. Provide the updated code with comments for clarity and ensure it integrates seamlessly with the existing React Router setup in `/frontend/src/App.jsx`.```
